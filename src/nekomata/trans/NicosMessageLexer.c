/* MACROS that hide the C interface implementations from the
 * generated code, which makes it a little more understandable to the human eye.
 * I am very much against using C pre-processor macros for function calls and bits
 * of code as you cannot see what is happening when single stepping in debuggers
 * and so on. The exception (in my book at least) is for generated code, where you are
 * not maintaining it, but may wish to read and understand it. If you single step it, you know that input()
 * hides some indirect calls, but is always referring to the input stream. This is
 * probably more readable than ctx->input->istream->input(snarfle0->blarg) and allows me to rejig
 * the runtime interfaces without changing the generated code too often, without
 * confusing the reader of the generated output, who may not wish to know the gory
 * details of the interface inheritance.
